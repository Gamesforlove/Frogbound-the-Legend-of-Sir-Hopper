dialog_5_2="You always do. What is it now?"
dialog_5_3="Do you think it's faster to boil water in a kettle or in a pot?"
dialog_5_4="Depends on the kettle and the pot. But they're all quite tedious."

dialog_1_10="To swim."
dialog_1_11="But do you swim... or does the water carry you?"
dialog_1_12="I swim."

dialog_1_14="Must."

dialog_1_30="Yes."

dialog_1_33="Ah, you are the hero! But what if the pond needed you more?"

dialog_1_42="..."
dialog_1_43="Is it a mirror... or a portal? Does the frog in the water live a different life?"
dialog_1_44="No."
dialog_1_45="Ah, but how can we know? What if that frog is... you, in reverse?"
dialog_1_46="I have no time for this."

dialog_2_1="Have you ever thought about the clouds?"
dialog_2_2="..."
dialog_2_3="They float, like dreams... but are they heavy dreams? Or light ones?"
dialog_2_4="Clouds are just rain."
dialog_2_5="Yes, but rain... is it the sky's sorrow, or the earth's gift?"
dialog_2_6="..."
dialog_2_7="Perhaps both! A sorrowful gift... like existence itself."
dialog_2_8="You hop, but why not swim forever?"
dialog_2_9="..."

dialog_3_1="The water, Sir Hopper... it's everywhere. Yet you leap. Are you not drawn to the depths?"
dialog_3_2="I need air."
dialog_3_3="Ah! Air... the illusion of freedom! We all breathe, but are we truly alive?"
dialog_3_4="I breathe fine."

dialog_4_1="The relics... They call to you, don't they?"
dialog_4_2="..."
dialog_4_3="But have you ever wondered what they want? Why they exist?"
dialog_4_4="No."
dialog_4_5="Perhaps they long to return... to something ancient, something... amphibian."
dialog_4_6="I just collect them."

dialog_5_1="The pond... So still, yet so full of life. Is it not like the universe?"
dialog_5_2="..."
dialog_5_3="Still on the surface, chaotic below. Which is more real, I wonder?"
dialog_5_4="..."
dialog_5_5="Is it the ripples we see... or the depths we fear?"
dialog_5_6="It's just a pond."

dialog_6_1="Do you think the wizard knows everything?"
dialog_6_2="..."
dialog_6_3="But how could he? Knowledge is a pond... deep and full of mystery."
dialog_6_4="He knows enough."
dialog_6_5="Ah, but does anyone know enough? Or are we all frogs, forever seeking... yet never finding?"
